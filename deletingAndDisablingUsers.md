# Deleting and Disabling Users
1. If you have deleted the OU folder called "Disable Users", recreate it.
2. Go back to Domain Users and select the user that you want to disable the account. I will use Paul Hill for this example.
3. Right click and click on **Disable Account**.<br>
It is good practice to move the disable account to the proper OU folder. So we are going to do that right now.<br>
4. Right-click the User and choose and we are going to choose Move.
5. Select **Disabled Users** and then click OK.

6. To delete the user, simply right click on the user then press delete. Make sure that it is the right user.

And that was the conclusion of the AD Fundamentals project!
