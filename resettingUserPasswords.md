# How to reset user passwords!
This is the easiest thing you will learn in this project.<br>

I will use the same example as last time in the “creatingActiveDirectoryUsers” page, which uses “Paul Hill” accounts. Please select the new User that you have created.

1. Select the account that you want to reset the password. In my case, is Paul Hill.
2. Right click on the account, then click on **Reset Password**

3. Type in the password that we want them to use, and we are going to say allow the user to change the password at the next logon.

4. Select **OK**

And that is all! See, I told you this was the easiest thing you will learn in this project.
